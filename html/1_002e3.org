*** 1.3Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: formulating-abstractions-with-higher-order-procedures
    :CLASS: section
    :END:

We have seen that procedures are, in effect, abstractions that describe compound operations on numbers independent of the particular numbers. For example, when we

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (cube x) (* x x x))
#+END_SRC

we are not talking about the cube of a particular number, but rather about a method for obtaining the cube of any number. Of course we could get along without ever defining this procedure, by always writing expressions such as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (* 3 3 3)
    (* x x x)
    (* y y y)
#+END_SRC

and never mentioning =cube= explicitly. This would place us at a serious disadvantage, forcing us to work always at the level of the particular operations that happen to be primitives in the language (multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of higher-level operations. Our programs would be able to compute cubes, but our language would lack the ability to express the concept of cubing. One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly. Procedures provide this ability. This is why all but the most primitive programming languages include mechanisms for defining procedures.

Yet even in numerical processing we will be severely limited in our ability to create abstractions if we are restricted to procedures whose parameters must be numbers. Often the same programming pattern will be used with a number of different procedures. To express such patterns as concepts, we will need to construct procedures that can accept procedures as arguments or return procedures as values. Procedures that manipulate procedures are called <<index-higher_002dorder-procedures>> /higher-order procedures/. This section shows how higher-order procedures can serve as powerful abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive power of our language.

**** 1.3.1Procedures as Arguments
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: procedures-as-arguments
     :CLASS: subsection
     :END:

Consider the following three procedures. The first computes the sum of the integers from =a= through =b=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sum-integers a b)
      (if (> a b) 
          0 
          (+ a (sum-integers (+ a 1) b))))
#+END_SRC

The second computes the sum of the cubes of the integers in the given range:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sum-cubes a b)
      (if (> a b) 
          0 
          (+ (cube a) 
             (sum-cubes (+ a 1) b))))
#+END_SRC

The third computes the sum of a sequence of terms in the series [[file:fig/math/f316427b55b2cae99386cc31549fae9d.svg]] which converges to [[file:fig/math/7036f8c43b937dd94b8729faff8921d8.svg]] (very slowly):^{[[#FOOT49][49]]}

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (pi-sum a b)
      (if (> a b)
          0
          (+ (/ 1.0 (* a (+ a 2))) 
             (pi-sum (+ a 4) b))))
#+END_SRC

These three procedures clearly share a common underlying pattern. They are for the most part identical, differing only in the name of the procedure, the function of =a= used to compute the term to be added, and the function that provides the next value of =a=. We could generate each of the procedures by filling in slots in the same template:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (⟨name⟩ a b)
      (if (> a b)
          0
          (+ (⟨term⟩ a) 
             (⟨name⟩ (⟨next⟩ a) b))))
#+END_SRC

The presence of such a common pattern is strong evidence that there is a useful abstraction waiting to be brought to the surface. Indeed, mathematicians long ago identified the abstraction of <<index-summation-of-a-series>> /summation of a series/ and invented “sigma notation,” for example [[file:fig/math/0eb2995b6eef64f53cec0011a7a1bf0a.svg]] to express this concept. The power of sigma notation is that it allows mathematicians to deal with the concept of summation itself rather than only with particular sums---for example, to formulate general results about sums that are independent of the particular series being summed.

Similarly, as program designers, we would like our language to be powerful enough so that we can write a procedure that expresses the concept of summation itself rather than only procedures that compute particular sums. We can do so readily in our procedural language by taking the common template shown above and transforming the “slots” into formal parameters:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sum term a next b)
      (if (> a b)
          0
          (+ (term a)
             (sum term (next a) next b))))
#+END_SRC

Notice that =sum= takes as its arguments the lower and upper bounds =a= and =b= together with the procedures =term= and =next=. We can use =sum= just as we would any procedure. For example, we can use it (along with a procedure =inc= that increments its argument by 1) to define =sum-cubes=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (inc n) (+ n 1))

    (define (sum-cubes a b)
      (sum cube a inc b))
#+END_SRC

Using this, we can compute the sum of the cubes of the integers from 1 to 10:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (sum-cubes 1 10)
    3025
#+END_SRC

With the aid of an identity procedure to compute the term, we can define =sum-integers= in terms of =sum=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (identity x) x)

    (define (sum-integers a b)
      (sum identity a inc b))
#+END_SRC

Then we can add up the integers from 1 to 10:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (sum-integers 1 10)
    55
#+END_SRC

We can also define =pi-sum= in the same way:^{[[#FOOT50][50]]}

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (pi-sum a b)
      (define (pi-term x)
        (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
      (define (pi-next x)
        (+ x 4))
      (sum pi-term a pi-next b))
#+END_SRC

Using these procedures, we can compute an approximation to [[file:fig/math/c25469cd205e957b38b51203870f48af.svg]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (* 8 (pi-sum 1 1000))
    3.139592655589783
#+END_SRC

Once we have =sum=, we can use it as a building block in formulating further concepts. For instance, the definite integral of a function [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] between the limits [[file:fig/math/09009cdd5fc245e05305bc574dcdc97d.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/3e92f417ccfc1f59b0ee22d034c85747.svg]] can be approximated numerically using the formula [[file:fig/math/86184e563a55746a1b5c8780393ed522.svg]] for small values of [[file:fig/math/a999758b4fd8ccd10d6eda8234629d51.svg]]. We can express this directly as a procedure:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (integral f a b dx)
      (define (add-dx x) (+ x dx))
      (* (sum f (+ a (/ dx 2.0)) add-dx b) 
         dx))

    (integral cube 0 1 0.01)
    .24998750000000042

    (integral cube 0 1 0.001)
    .249999875000001
#+END_SRC

(The exact value of the integral of =cube= between 0 and 1 is 1/4.)

**** 1.3.2Constructing Procedures Using =Lambda=
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: constructing-procedures-using-lambda
     :CLASS: subsection
     :END:

In using =sum= as in [[#g_t1_002e3_002e1][1.3.1]], it seems terribly awkward to have to define trivial procedures such as =pi-term= and =pi-next= just so we can use them as arguments to our higher-order procedure. Rather than define =pi-next= and =pi-term=, it would be more convenient to have a way to directly specify “the procedure that returns its input incremented by 4” and “the procedure that returns the reciprocal of its input times its input plus 2.” We can do this by introducing the special form =lambda=, which creates procedures. Using =lambda= we can describe what we want as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (lambda (x) (+ x 4))
#+END_SRC

and

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (lambda (x) (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
#+END_SRC

Then our =pi-sum= procedure can be expressed without defining any auxiliary procedures as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (pi-sum a b)
      (sum (lambda (x) (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
           a
           (lambda (x) (+ x 4))
           b))
#+END_SRC

Again using =lambda=, we can write the =integral= procedure without having to define the auxiliary procedure =add-dx=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (integral f a b dx)
      (* (sum f (+ a (/ dx 2.0))
                (lambda (x) (+ x dx))
                b)
         dx))
#+END_SRC

In general, =lambda= is used to create procedures in the same way as =define=, except that no name is specified for the procedure:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (lambda (⟨formal-parameters⟩) ⟨body⟩)
#+END_SRC

The resulting procedure is just as much a procedure as one that is created using =define=. The only difference is that it has not been associated with any name in the environment. In fact,

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (plus4 x) (+ x 4))
#+END_SRC

is equivalent to

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define plus4 (lambda (x) (+ x 4)))
#+END_SRC

We can read a =lambda= expression as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (lambda                     (x)     (+   x     4))
        |                        |       |   |     |
    the procedure of an argument x that adds x and 4
#+END_EXAMPLE

Like any expression that has a procedure as its value, a =lambda= expression can be used as the operator in a combination such as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    ((lambda (x y z) (+ x y (square z))) 1 2 3)
    12
#+END_SRC

or, more generally, in any context where we would normally use a procedure name.^{[[#FOOT53][53]]}

<<Using-let-to-create-local-variables>>

      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: using-let-to-create-local-variables
      :CLASS: subsubheading
      :END:

Another use of =lambda= is in creating local variables. We often need local variables in our procedures other than those that have been bound as formal parameters. For example, suppose we wish to compute the function [[file:fig/math/fe77b247f1b571631311f5e0e0a8559d.svg]] which we could also express as [[file:fig/math/19531eed609e9a8dd489a1e7f8434630.svg]] In writing a procedure to compute [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]], we would like to include as local variables not only [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] but also the names of intermediate quantities like [[file:fig/math/09009cdd5fc245e05305bc574dcdc97d.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/3e92f417ccfc1f59b0ee22d034c85747.svg]]. One way to accomplish this is to use an auxiliary procedure to bind the local variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (f x y)
      (define (f-helper a b)
        (+ (* x (square a))
           (* y b)
           (* a b)))
      (f-helper (+ 1 (* x y)) 
                (- 1 y)))
#+END_SRC

Of course, we could use a =lambda= expression to specify an anonymous procedure for binding our local variables. The body of =f= then becomes a single call to that procedure:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (f x y)
      ((lambda (a b)
         (+ (* x (square a)) 
            (* y b) 
            (* a b)))
       (+ 1 (* x y))
       (- 1 y)))
#+END_SRC

This construct is so useful that there is a special form called =let= to make its use more convenient. Using =let=, the =f= procedure could be written as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (f x y)
      (let ((a (+ 1 (* x y)))
            (b (- 1 y)))
        (+ (* x (square a))
           (* y b)
           (* a b))))
#+END_SRC

The general form of a =let= expression is

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (let ((⟨var₁⟩ ⟨exp₁⟩)
          (⟨var₂⟩ ⟨exp₂⟩)
          …
          (⟨varₙ⟩ ⟨expₙ⟩))
      ⟨body⟩)
#+END_SRC

which can be thought of as saying

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    let ⟨var₁⟩ have the value ⟨exp₁⟩ and
        ⟨var₂⟩ have the value ⟨exp₂⟩ and
        …
        ⟨varₙ⟩ have the value ⟨expₙ⟩
      in ⟨body⟩
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first part of the =let= expression is a list of name-expression pairs. When the =let= is evaluated, each name is associated with the value of the corresponding expression. The body of the =let= is evaluated with these names bound as local variables. The way this happens is that the =let= expression is interpreted as an alternate syntax for

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    ((lambda (⟨var₁⟩ … ⟨varₙ⟩)
       ⟨body⟩)
     ⟨exp₁⟩
     …
     ⟨expₙ⟩)
#+END_SRC

No new mechanism is required in the interpreter in order to provide local variables. A =let= expression is simply syntactic sugar for the underlying =lambda= application.

We can see from this equivalence that the scope of a variable specified by a =let= expression is the body of the =let=. This implies that:

- =Let= allows one to bind variables as locally as possible to where they are to be used. For example, if the value of =x= is 5, the value of the expression

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (+ (let ((x 3))
           (+ x (* x 10)))
         x)
  #+END_SRC

  is 38. Here, the =x= in the body of the =let= is 3, so the value of the =let= expression is 33. On the other hand, the =x= that is the second argument to the outermost =+= is still 5.

- The variables' values are computed outside the =let=. This matters when the expressions that provide the values for the local variables depend upon variables having the same names as the local variables themselves. For example, if the value of =x= is 2, the expression

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (let ((x 3)
            (y (+ x 2)))
        (* x y))
  #+END_SRC

  will have the value 12 because, inside the body of the =let=, =x= will be 3 and =y= will be 4 (which is the outer =x= plus 2).

Sometimes we can use internal definitions to get the same effect as with =let=. For example, we could have defined the procedure =f= above as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (f x y)
      (define a 
        (+ 1 (* x y)))
      (define b (- 1 y))
      (+ (* x (square a))
         (* y b)
         (* a b)))
#+END_SRC

We prefer, however, to use =let= in situations like this and to use internal =define= only for internal procedures.^{[[#FOOT54][54]]}

The idea is that, if we are given points [[file:fig/math/09009cdd5fc245e05305bc574dcdc97d.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/3e92f417ccfc1f59b0ee22d034c85747.svg]] such that [[file:fig/math/2ebbda41ddf9bbce8a5cf027170ce10d.svg]], then [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] must have at least one zero between [[file:fig/math/09009cdd5fc245e05305bc574dcdc97d.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/3e92f417ccfc1f59b0ee22d034c85747.svg]]. To locate a zero, let [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] be the average of [[file:fig/math/09009cdd5fc245e05305bc574dcdc97d.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/3e92f417ccfc1f59b0ee22d034c85747.svg]], and compute [[file:fig/math/b057a8e52b609c9d7031fbe3992972ef.svg]]. If [[file:fig/math/45a3fd031ce7e15eac4c6477cdc6a3a1.svg]], then [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] must have a zero between [[file:fig/math/09009cdd5fc245e05305bc574dcdc97d.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]]. If [[file:fig/math/7f0eaa927815e7643164bd4538441b42.svg]], then [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] must have a zero between [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/3e92f417ccfc1f59b0ee22d034c85747.svg]]. Continuing in this way, we can identify smaller and smaller intervals on which [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] must have a zero. When we reach a point where the interval is small enough, the process stops. Since the interval of uncertainty is reduced by half at each step of the process, the number of steps required grows as [[file:fig/math/0965cc2fcc7d9b8980211f23a76a1ee5.svg]], where [[file:fig/math/a23a2cd0225c802f8f86942524b01811.svg]] is the length of the original interval and [[file:fig/math/f06926aab0bc0e9f47ee2cd90f581bb2.svg]] is the error tolerance (that is, the size of the interval we will consider “small enough”). Here is a procedure that implements this strategy:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (search f neg-point pos-point)
      (let ((midpoint 
             (average neg-point pos-point)))
        (if (close-enough? neg-point pos-point)
            midpoint
            (let ((test-value (f midpoint)))
              (cond 
               ((positive? test-value)
                (search f neg-point midpoint))
               ((negative? test-value)
                (search f midpoint pos-point))
               (else midpoint))))))
#+END_SRC

We assume that we are initially given the function [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] together with points at which its values are negative and positive. We first compute the midpoint of the two given points. Next we check to see if the given interval is small enough, and if so we simply return the midpoint as our answer. Otherwise, we compute as a test value the value of [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] at the midpoint. If the test value is positive, then we continue the process with a new interval running from the original negative point to the midpoint. If the test value is negative, we continue with the interval from the midpoint to the positive point. Finally, there is the possibility that the test value is 0, in which case the midpoint is itself the root we are searching for.

To test whether the endpoints are “close enough” we can use a procedure similar to the one used in [[file:1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7][1.1.7]] for computing square roots:^{[[#FOOT55][55]]}

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (close-enough? x y) 
      (< (abs (- x y)) 0.001))
#+END_SRC

=Search= is awkward to use directly, because we can accidentally give it points at which [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]]'s values do not have the required sign, in which case we get a wrong answer. Instead we will use =search= via the following procedure, which checks to see which of the endpoints has a negative function value and which has a positive value, and calls the =search= procedure accordingly. If the function has the same sign on the two given points, the half-interval method cannot be used, in which case the procedure signals an error.^{[[#FOOT56][56]]}

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (half-interval-method f a b)
      (let ((a-value (f a))
            (b-value (f b)))
        (cond ((and (negative? a-value) 
                    (positive? b-value))
               (search f a b))
              ((and (negative? b-value) 
                    (positive? a-value))
               (search f b a))
              (else
               (error "Values are not of 
                       opposite sign" a b)))))

A number [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] is called a <<index-fixed-point>> /fixed point/ of a function [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] if [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] satisfies the equation [[file:fig/math/6973ec387c2ca776b59c0e24f3854033.svg]]. For some functions [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] we can locate a fixed point by beginning with an initial guess and applying [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]] repeatedly, [[file:fig/math/e4fa5e281403a0f9850cfc9651238cbe.svg]] until the value does not change very much. Using this idea, we can devise a procedure =fixed-point= that takes as inputs a function and an initial guess and produces an approximation to a fixed point of the function. We apply the function repeatedly until we find two successive values whose difference is less than some prescribed tolerance:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define tolerance 0.00001)

    (define (fixed-point f first-guess)
      (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
        (< (abs (- v1 v2)) 
           tolerance))
      (define (try guess)
        (let ((next (f guess)))
          (if (close-enough? guess next)
              next
              (try next))))
      (try first-guess))
#+END_SRC

For example, we can use this method to approximate the fixed point of the cosine function, starting with 1 as an initial approximation:^{[[#FOOT57][57]]}

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (fixed-point cos 1.0)
    .7390822985224023
#+END_SRC

Similarly, we can find a solution to the equation [[file:fig/math/0aa55add0239835caa875b8d063befab.svg]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (fixed-point (lambda (y) (+ (sin y) (cos y)))
                 1.0)
    1.2587315962971173
#+END_SRC

The fixed-point process is reminiscent of the process we used for finding square roots in [[file:1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7][1.1.7]]. Both are based on the idea of repeatedly improving a guess until the result satisfies some criterion. In fact, we can readily formulate the square-root computation as a fixed-point search. Computing the square root of some number [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] requires finding a [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] such that [[file:fig/math/437588ce11e8725cc98d93e391d57fb8.svg]]. Putting this equation into the equivalent form [[file:fig/math/aef045715ec76889ad7e84fd30b5a3da.svg]], we recognize that we are looking for a fixed point of the function^{[[#FOOT58][58]]} [[file:fig/math/c4888039e8855b22c0b35c8152532a53.svg]], and we can therefore try to compute square roots as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sqrt x)
      (fixed-point (lambda (y) (/ x y))
                   1.0))
#+END_SRC

Unfortunately, this fixed-point search does not converge. Consider an initial guess [[file:fig/math/c5f215b61ceace6c2622b08df19fb269.svg]]. The next guess is [[file:fig/math/3a5198b6c94fee8a5e5da16dea15f2c1.svg]] and the next guess is [[file:fig/math/ef078e24ed6d43614dbc6ec03136667b.svg]]. This results in an infinite loop in which the two guesses [[file:fig/math/c5f215b61ceace6c2622b08df19fb269.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/a920968ff08c279a310e14973392bff2.svg]] repeat over and over, oscillating about the answer.

One way to control such oscillations is to prevent the guesses from changing so much. Since the answer is always between our guess [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/c243e54e1f37c985a92584d386f5fc01.svg]], we can make a new guess that is not as far from [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] as [[file:fig/math/c243e54e1f37c985a92584d386f5fc01.svg]] by averaging [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] with [[file:fig/math/c243e54e1f37c985a92584d386f5fc01.svg]], so that the next guess after [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] is [[file:fig/math/e0b5c0d3af60453a97c1ebc178392557.svg]] instead of [[file:fig/math/c243e54e1f37c985a92584d386f5fc01.svg]]. The process of making such a sequence of guesses is simply the process of looking for a fixed point of [[file:fig/math/d90156d1aee4bac4abaecee76393e388.svg]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sqrt x)
      (fixed-point 
       (lambda (y) (average y (/ x y)))

#+END_SRC

(Note that [[file:fig/math/27ff6df3c794eeaefd63a451e9c8b048.svg]] is a simple transformation of the equation [[file:fig/math/de826a8541eddb4099cf005d61b5a8b5.svg]] to derive it, add [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] to both sides of the equation and divide by 2.)

With this modification, the square-root procedure works. In fact, if we unravel the definitions, we can see that the sequence of approximations to the square root generated here is precisely the same as the one generated by our original square-root procedure of [[file:1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7][1.1.7]]. This approach of averaging successive approximations to a solution, a technique that we call <<index-average-damping>> /average damping/, often aids the convergence of fixed-point searches.

     :CUSTOM_ID: procedures-as-returned-values
     :CLASS: subsection
     :END:

The above examples demonstrate how the ability to pass procedures as arguments significantly enhances the expressive power of our programming language. We can achieve even more expressive power by creating procedures whose returned values are themselves procedures.

We can illustrate this idea by looking again at the fixed-point example described at the end of [[#g_t1_002e3_002e3][1.3.3]]. We formulated a new version of the square-root procedure as a fixed-point search, starting with the observation that [[file:fig/math/f23ea9ccf69a299490e5f1e45389dbb0.svg]] is a fixed-point of the function [[file:fig/math/ddef7e56a0f80929eef40b1233f2c0d6.svg]]. Then we used average damping to make the approximations converge. Average damping is a useful general technique in itself. Namely, given a function [[file:fig/math/7a8d165d31a04fc319968e0213091ff8.svg]], we consider the function whose value at [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] is equal to the average of [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/b057a8e52b609c9d7031fbe3992972ef.svg]].

We can express the idea of average damping by means of the following procedure:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (average-damp f)
      (lambda (x) 
        (average x (f x))))
#+END_SRC

=Average-damp= is a procedure that takes as its argument a procedure =f= and returns as its value a procedure (produced by the =lambda=) that, when applied to a number =x=, produces the average of =x= and =(f x)=. For example, applying =average-damp= to the =square= procedure produces a procedure whose value at some number [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] is the average of [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/4067ede5e74e99831d02a03c863d4f61.svg]]. Applying this resulting procedure to 10 returns the average of 10 and 100, or 55:^{[[#FOOT59][59]]}

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    ((average-damp square) 10)
    55
#+END_SRC

Using =average-damp=, we can reformulate the square-root procedure as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sqrt x)
      (fixed-point 
       (average-damp 
        (lambda (y) (/ x y)))
       1.0))
#+END_SRC

Notice how this formulation makes explicit the three ideas in the method: fixed-point search, average damping, and the function [[file:fig/math/c4888039e8855b22c0b35c8152532a53.svg]]. It is instructive to compare this formulation of the square-root method with the original version given in [[file:1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7][1.1.7]]. Bear in mind that these procedures express the same process, and notice how much clearer the idea becomes when we express the process in terms of these abstractions. In general, there are many ways to formulate a process as a procedure. Experienced programmers know how to choose procedural formulations that are particularly perspicuous, and where useful elements of the process are exposed as separate entities that can be reused in other applications. As a simple example of reuse, notice that the cube root of [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] is a fixed point of the function [[file:fig/math/18bb0b98243514be22ca3fe084b0b07a.svg]], so we can immediately generalize our square-root procedure to one that extracts cube roots:^{[[#FOOT60][60]]}

When we first introduced the square-root procedure, in [[file:1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7][1.1.7]], we mentioned that this was a special case of <<index-Newton_0027s-method>> /Newton's method/. If [[file:fig/math/b8d7965e16f1c2bfd1e3352f2f7b5441.svg]] is a differentiable function, then a solution of the equation [[file:fig/math/1bb87b4a000856347a1692e05ca9bf3f.svg]] is a fixed point of the function [[file:fig/math/e989fa4d5f44c42efde2012a986077b1.svg]] where [[file:fig/math/081fda9357220fdc133ee7405c8ad84d.svg]] and [[file:fig/math/9b5f6180b46c2f42142132b6707d8307.svg]] is the derivative of [[file:fig/math/658545a813335885e643f33ae78074bc.svg]] evaluated at [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]]. Newton's method is the use of the fixed-point method we saw above to approximate a solution of the equation by finding a fixed point of the function [[file:fig/math/24281a3bb1d277b889b72378360aef7a.svg]].^{[[#FOOT61][61]]}

For many functions [[file:fig/math/658545a813335885e643f33ae78074bc.svg]] and for sufficiently good initial guesses for [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]], Newton's method converges very rapidly to a solution of [[file:fig/math/1bb87b4a000856347a1692e05ca9bf3f.svg]].^{[[#FOOT62][62]]}

In order to implement Newton's method as a procedure, we must first express the idea of derivative. Note that “derivative,” like average damping, is something that transforms a function into another function. For instance, the derivative of the function [[file:fig/math/ac425fd6c307d8ccc07cc03c895b9e7d.svg]] is the function [[file:fig/math/ac7ca6931c571d4a707b5ebb95bf9994.svg]]. In general, if [[file:fig/math/658545a813335885e643f33ae78074bc.svg]] is a function and [[file:fig/math/a999758b4fd8ccd10d6eda8234629d51.svg]] is a small number, then the derivative [[file:fig/math/60f9f23f14887c92a25e763ddb432825.svg]] of [[file:fig/math/658545a813335885e643f33ae78074bc.svg]] is the function whose value at any number [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]] is given (in the limit of small [[file:fig/math/a999758b4fd8ccd10d6eda8234629d51.svg]]) by [[file:fig/math/51b1ca2619c2a00fbaffbeaa70e8c8d0.svg]] Thus, we can express the idea of derivative (taking [[file:fig/math/a999758b4fd8ccd10d6eda8234629d51.svg]] to be, say, 0.00001) as the procedure

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (deriv g)
      (lambda (x)
        (/ (- (g (+ x dx)) (g x))
           dx)))
#+END_SRC

along with the definition

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define dx 0.00001)
#+END_SRC

Like =average-damp=, =deriv= is a procedure that takes a procedure as argument and returns a procedure as value. For example, to approximate the derivative of [[file:fig/math/ac425fd6c307d8ccc07cc03c895b9e7d.svg]] at 5 (whose exact value is 75) we can evaluate

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (cube x) (* x x x))

    ((deriv cube) 5)
    75.00014999664018
#+END_SRC

With the aid of =deriv=, we can express Newton's method as a fixed-point process:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (newton-transform g)
      (lambda (x)
        (- x (/ (g x) 
                ((deriv g) x)))))

    (define (newtons-method g guess)
      (fixed-point (newton-transform g) 
                   guess))
#+END_SRC

The =newton-transform= procedure expresses the formula at the beginning of this section, and =newtons-method= is readily defined in terms of this. It takes as arguments a procedure that computes the function for which we want to find a zero, together with an initial guess. For instance, to find the square root of [[file:fig/math/2f4b15565d0a1018e90c3e1b30b76acc.svg]], we can use Newton's method to find a zero of the function [[file:fig/math/9294c125cde969bc121635c17a573a38.svg]] starting with an initial guess of 1.^{[[#FOOT63][63]]}

This provides yet another form of the square-root procedure:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sqrt x)
      (newtons-method 
       (lambda (y) 
         (- (square y) x)) 
       1.0))
#+END_SRC

***** Abstractions and first-class procedures
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: abstractions-and-first-class-procedures
      :CLASS: subsubheading
      :END:

We've seen two ways to express the square-root computation as an instance of a more general method, once as a fixed-point search and once using Newton's method. Since Newton's method was itself expressed as a fixed-point process, we actually saw two ways to compute square roots as fixed points. Each method begins with a function and finds a fixed point of some transformation of the function. We can express this general idea itself as a procedure:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (fixed-point-of-transform 
             g transform guess)
      (fixed-point (transform g) guess))
#+END_SRC

This very general procedure takes as its arguments a procedure =g= that computes some function, a procedure that transforms =g=, and an initial guess. The returned result is a fixed point of the transformed function.

Using this abstraction, we can recast the first square-root computation from this section (where we look for a fixed point of the average-damped version of [[file:fig/math/c4888039e8855b22c0b35c8152532a53.svg]]) as an instance of this general method:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sqrt x)
      (fixed-point-of-transform 
       (lambda (y) (/ x y))
       average-damp
       1.0))
#+END_SRC

Similarly, we can express the second square-root computation from this section (an instance of Newton's method that finds a fixed point of the Newton transform of [[file:fig/math/9294c125cde969bc121635c17a573a38.svg]]) as

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (define (sqrt x)
      (fixed-point-of-transform 
       (lambda (y) (- (square y) x))
       newton-transform
       1.0))
#+END_SRC

We began section [[#g_t1_002e3][1.3]] with the observation that compound procedures are a crucial abstraction mechanism, because they permit us to express general methods of computing as explicit elements in our programming language. Now we've seen how higher-order procedures permit us to manipulate these general methods to create further abstractions.

As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs and to build upon them and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions. This is not to say that one should always write programs in the most abstract way possible; expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task. But it is important to be able to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to apply them in new contexts. The significance of higher-order procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements.

In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have <<index-first_002dclass>> /first-class/ status. Some of the “rights and privileges” of first-class elements are:^{[[#FOOT64][64]]}

- They may be named by variables.
- They may be passed as arguments to procedures.
- They may be returned as the results of procedures.
- They may be included in data structures.^{[[#FOOT65][65]]}

Lisp, unlike other common programming languages, awards procedures full first-class status. This poses challenges for efficient implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.^{[[#FOOT66][66]]}

On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of [[file:fig/math/ee3c68d0350ab75033b5737a37031060.svg]]) the fixed-point search does converge.

[[#DOCF49][^{49}]] This series, usually written in the equivalent form [[file:fig/math/8fb226294dc22a2a6271b433e09a1435.svg]], is due to Leibniz. We'll see how to use this as the basis for some fancy numerical tricks in [[file:3_002e5.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e3][3.5.3]].

[[#DOCF50][^{50}]] Notice that we have used block structure ([[file:1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e8][1.1.8]]) to embed the definitions of =pi-next= and =pi-term= within =pi-sum=, since these procedures are unlikely to be useful for any other purpose. We will see how to get rid of them altogether in [[#g_t1_002e3_002e2][1.3.2]].

[[#DOCF51][^{51}]] The intent of [[#Exercise-1_002e31][Exercise 1.31]] through [[#Exercise-1_002e33][Exercise 1.33]] is to demonstrate the expressive power that is attained by using an appropriate abstraction to consolidate many seemingly disparate operations. However, though accumulation and filtering are elegant ideas, our hands are somewhat tied in using them at this point since we do not yet have data structures to provide suitable means of combination for these abstractions. We will return to these ideas in [[file:2_002e2.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e3][2.2.3]] when we show how to use <<index-sequences>> /sequences/ as interfaces for combining filters and accumulators to build even more powerful abstractions. We will see there how these methods really come into their own as a powerful and elegant approach to designing programs.

[[#DOCF52][^{52}]] This formula was discovered by the seventeenth-century English mathematician John Wallis.

[[#DOCF53][^{53}]] It would be clearer and less intimidating to people learning Lisp if a name more obvious than =lambda=, such as =make-procedure=, were used. But the convention is firmly entrenched. The notation is adopted from the λ-calculus, a mathematical formalism introduced by the mathematical logician Alonzo [[file:References.xhtml#Church-_00281941_0029][Church (1941)]]. Church developed the λ-calculus to provide a rigorous foundation for studying the notions of function and function application. The λ-calculus has become a basic tool for mathematical investigations of the semantics of programming languages.

[[#DOCF54][^{54}]] Understanding internal definitions well enough to be sure a program means what we intend it to mean requires a more elaborate model of the evaluation process than we have presented in this chapter. The subtleties do not arise with internal definitions of procedures, however. We will return to this issue in [[file:4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e6][4.1.6]], after we learn more about evaluation.

[[#DOCF55][^{55}]] We have used 0.001 as a representative “small” number to indicate a tolerance for the acceptable error in a calculation. The appropriate tolerance for a real calculation depends upon the problem to be solved and the limitations of the computer and the algorithm. This is often a very subtle consideration, requiring help from a numerical analyst or some other kind of magician.

[[#DOCF56][^{56}]] This can be accomplished using =error=, which takes as arguments a number of items that are printed as error messages.

[[#DOCF57][^{57}]] Try this during a boring lecture: Set your calculator to radians mode and then repeatedly press the =cos= button until you obtain the fixed point.

[[#DOCF58][^{58}]] [[file:fig/math/0ce91553aad27651969cc77ddd0cb826.svg]] (pronounced “maps to”) is the mathematician's way of writing =lambda=. [[file:fig/math/c4888039e8855b22c0b35c8152532a53.svg]] means =(lambda (y) (/ x y))=, that is, the function whose value at [[file:fig/math/05e4cdb2f26a4f66b68c167423907fea.svg]] is [[file:fig/math/c243e54e1f37c985a92584d386f5fc01.svg]].

[[#DOCF59][^{59}]] Observe that this is a combination whose operator is itself a combination. [[file:1_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-1_002e4][Exercise 1.4]] already demonstrated the ability to form such combinations, but that was only a toy example. Here we begin to see the real need for such combinations---when applying a procedure that is obtained as the value returned by a higher-order procedure.

[[#DOCF60][^{60}]] See [[#Exercise-1_002e45][Exercise 1.45]] for a further generalization.

[[#DOCF61][^{61}]] Elementary calculus books usually describe Newton's method in terms of the sequence of approximations [[file:fig/math/96cbc64b5b9346071e74621f47f63af6.svg]]. Having language for talking about processes and using the idea of fixed points simplifies the description of the method.

[[#DOCF62][^{62}]] Newton's method does not always converge to an answer, but it can be shown that in favorable cases each iteration doubles the number-of-digits accuracy of the approximation to the solution. In such cases, Newton's method will converge much more rapidly than the half-interval method.

[[#DOCF63][^{63}]] For finding square roots, Newton's method converges rapidly to the correct solution from any starting point.

[[#DOCF64][^{64}]] The notion of first-class status of programming-language elements is due to the British computer scientist Christopher Strachey (1916-1975).

[[#DOCF65][^{65}]] We'll see examples of this after we introduce data structures in [[file:Chapter-2.xhtml#Chapter-2][Chapter 2]].

[[#DOCF66][^{66}]] The major implementation cost of first-class procedures is that allowing procedures to be returned as values requires reserving storage for a procedure's free variables even while the procedure is not executing. In the Scheme implementation we will study in [[file:4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1][4.1]], these variables are stored in the procedure's environment.

Next: [[file:Chapter-2.xhtml#Chapter-2][Chapter 2]], Prev: [[file:1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2][1.2]], Up: [[#g_t1_002e3][1.3]]   [[[file:index.xhtml#SEC_Contents][Contents]]]
